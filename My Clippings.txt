Work out what you can reasonably ask for. Develop it well. Once you've got it, show people, and let them marvel. Then say "of course, it would be better if we added…." Pretend it's not important. Sit back and wait for them to start asking you to add the functionality you originally wanted. People find it easier to join an ongoing success.

There is an easy test for orthogonal design. Once you have your components mapped out, ask yourself: If I dramatically change the requirements behind a particular function, how many modules are affected? In an orthogonal system, the answer should be "one."[3] Moving a button on a GUI panel should not require a change in the database schema. Adding context-sensitive help should not change the billing subsystem.

And the fact that you get pissed off so easily starts to piss you off even more. And then, in your petty rage, you realize that being angry all the time makes you a shallow and mean person, and you hate this; you hate it so much that you get angry at yourself.

The truth is that there’s no such thing as a personal problem. If you’ve got a problem, chances are millions of other people have had it in the past, have it now, and are going to have it in the future. Likely people you know too. That doesn’t minimize the problem or mean that it shouldn’t hurt. It doesn’t mean you aren’t legitimately a victim in some circumstances. It just means that you’re not special.

The rare people who do become truly exceptional at something do so not because they believe they’re exceptional. On the contrary, they become amazing because they’re obsessed with improvement. And that obsession with improvement stems from an unerring belief that they are, in fact, not that great at all. It’s anti-entitlement. People who become great at something become great because they understand that they’re not already great—they are mediocre, they are average—and that they could be so much better.

Growth is an endlessly iterative process. When we learn something new, we don’t go from “wrong” to “right.” Rather, we go from wrong to slightly less wrong. And when we learn something additional, we go from slightly less wrong to slightly less wrong than that, and then to even less wrong than that, and so on. We are always in the process of approaching truth and perfection without actually ever reaching truth or perfection.

There’s a kind of self-absorption that comes with fear based on an irrational certainty. When you assume that your plane is the one that’s going to crash, or that your project idea is the stupid one everyone is going to laugh at, or that you’re the one everyone is going to choose to mock or ignore, you’re implicitly telling yourself, “I’m the exception; I’m unlike everybody else; I’m different and special.” This is narcissism, pure and simple. You feel as though your problems deserve to be treated differently, that your problems have some unique math to them that doesn’t obey the laws of the physical universe. My recommendation: don’t be special; don’t be unique. Redefine your metrics in mundane and broad ways. Choose to measure yourself not as a rising star or an undiscovered genius.

The truth is, there are healthy forms of love and unhealthy forms of love. Unhealthy love is based on two people trying to escape their problems through their emotions for each other—in other words, they’re using each other as an escape. Healthy love is based on two people acknowledging and addressing their own problems with each other’s support.

The mark of an unhealthy relationship is two people who try to solve each other’s problems in order to feel good about themselves. Rather, a healthy relationship is when two people solve their own problems in order to feel good about each other. The setting of proper boundaries doesn’t mean you can’t help or support your partner or be helped and supported yourself. You both should support each other. But only because you choose to support and be supported. Not because you feel obligated or entitled.

It can be difficult for people to recognize the difference between doing something out of obligation and doing it voluntarily. So here’s a litmus test: ask yourself, “If I refused, how would the relationship change?” Similarly, ask, “If my partner refused something I wanted, how would the relationship change?” If the answer is that a refusal would cause a blowout of drama and broken china plates, then that’s a bad sign for your relationship. It suggests that your relationship is conditional—based on superficial benefits received from one another, rather than on unconditional acceptance of each other (along with each other’s problems).

Every day, you’ll choose a single activity to prioritize and protect in your calendar. It might be an important goal at work, like finishing a presentation. You might choose something at home, like cooking dinner or planting your garden. Your Highlight might be something you don’t necessarily have to do but want to do, like playing with your kids or reading a book. Your Highlight can contain multiple steps; for example, finishing that presentation might include writing the closing remarks, completing the slides, and doing a practice run-through. By setting “finish presentation” as your Highlight, you commit to complete all the tasks required.

A good rule of thumb is to choose a Highlight that takes sixty to ninety minutes. If you spend less than sixty minutes, you might not have time to get in the zone, but after ninety minutes of focused attention, most people need a break. Sixty to ninety minutes is a sweet spot. It’s enough time to do something meaningful, and it’s a reasonable amount of time to create in your schedule.

The most frequently expressed complaint women have about men is that men don't listen. Either a man completely ignores her when she speaks to him, or he listens for a few beats, assesses what is bothering her, and then proudly puts on his Mr. Fix-It cap and offers her a solution to make her feel better. He is confused when she doesn't appreciate this gesture of love. No matter how many times she tells him that he's not listening, he doesn't get it and keeps doing the same thing.

When a man is stuck in his cave, he is powerless to give his partner the quality attention she deserves. It is hard for her to be accepting of him at these times because she doesn't know how stressed he is. If he were to come home and talk about all his problems, then she could be more compassionate. Instead he doesn't talk about his problems, and she feels he is ignoring her. She can tell he is upset but mistakenly assumes he doesn't care about her because he isn't talking to her.

Women generally do not understand how Martians cope with stress. They expect men to open up and talk about all their problems the way Venusians do. When a man is stuck in his cave, a woman resents his not being more open. She feels hurt when he turns on the news or goes outside to play some basketball and ignores her.

The Martians realized that even when they felt they were being attacked, blamed, or criticized by the Venusians it was only temporary; soon the Venusians would suddenly feel better and be very appreciative and accepting. By learning to listen, the Martians discovered how much the Venusians really thrived on talking about problems.

Like the Venusians, women are motivated and empowered when they feel cherished. When a woman does not feel cherished in a relationship she gradually becomes compulsively responsible and exhausted from giving too much. On the other hand when she feels cared for and respected, she is fulfilled and has more to give as well.

Most men have little awareness of how important it is to a woman to feel supported by someone who cares. Women are happy when they believe their needs will be met. When a woman is upset, overwhelmed, confused, exhausted, or hopeless what she needs most is simple companionship. She needs to feel she is not alone. She needs to feel loved and cherished.

Men don't realize this because their Martian instincts tell them it's best to be alone when they are upset. When she is upset, out of respect he will leave her alone, or if he stays he makes matters worse by trying to solve her problems. He does not instinctively realize how very important closeness, intimacy, and sharing are to her.

Instead of blaming a man for giving less, a woman can accept and forgive her partner's imperfections, especially when he disappoints her, trust that he wants to give more when lie doesn't offer his support, and encourage him to give more by appreciating what he does give and continuing to ask for his support.

Quite often, when one partner makes a positive change the other will also change. This predictable coincidence is one of those magical things about life. When the student is ready the teacher appears. When the question is asked then the answer is heard. When we are truly ready to receive then what we need will become available. When the Venusians were ready to receive, the Martians were ready to give.

"Everyone ignores me" translated into Martian means "Today, I am feeling ignored and unacknowledged. I feel as though nobody sees me. Of course I'm sure some people see me, but they don't seem to care about me. I suppose I am also disappointed that you have been so busy lately. 1 really do appreciate how hard you are working and sometimes I start to feel like 1 am not important to you. I am afraid your work is more important than me. Would you give me a hug and tell me how special 1 am to you?"

when you’re feeling absolutely unmotivated, one very simple solution that I employ all the time—in fact, don’t tell anyone, but I’m employing it right now—is to sit down, set a timer for 15 minutes, and start working. During that 15-minute timer, you have to work. You can’t allow yourself to become distracted; you must focus on the task at hand. After 15 minutes of clear, focused work, you’ll probably find it’s much easier to keep moving forward. It turns out that once we give our undivided attention to something for that long, we end up getting drawn into what we’re doing, and we have some motivation to continue. I call this momentum.

var month = "06", year = "09"; month = parseInt(month, 10); year = parseInt(year, 10); In this example, if you omit the radix parameter like parseInt(year), the returned value will be 0, because “09” assumes octal number (as if you did parseInt(year, 8)) and 09 is not a valid digit in base 8.

Imagine you have a for loop with one statement only. You could omit the braces and there will be no syntax error: // bad practice for (var i = 0; i < 10; i += 1) alert(i); But what if, later on, you add another line in the body of the loop? // bad practice for (var i = 0; i < 10; i += 1) alert(i); alert(i + " is " + (i % 2 ? "odd" : "even")); The second alert is outside the loop although the indentation may trick you. The best thing to do in the long run is to always use the braces, even for one-line blocks: // better for (var i = 0; i < 10; i += 1) { alert(i); }

// warning: unexpected return value function func() { return { name: "Batman" }; } If you expect this function to return an object with a name property, you’ll be surprised. Because of the implied semicolons, the function returns undefined. The preceding code is equivalent to this one: // warning: unexpected return value function func() { return undefined; // unreachable code follows... { name: "Batman" }; } In conclusion, always use curly braces and always put the opening one on the same line as the previous statement: function func() { return { name: "Batman" }; }

When you have multiple words in a variable or a function name, it’s a good idea to follow a convention as to how the words will be separated. A common convention is to use the so-called camel case. Following the camel case convention, you type the words in lowercase, only capitalizing the first letter in each word. For your constructors, you can use upper camel case, as in MyConstructor(), and for function and method names, you can use lower camel case, as in myFunction(), calculateArea() and getFirstName().

there is no way to define constants in JavaScript (although there are some built-in such as Number.MAX_VALUE), so developers have adopted the convention of using all-caps for naming variables that shouldn’t change values during the life of the program, like: // precious constants, please don't touch var PI = 3.14,

You shouldn’t go overboard commenting the obvious: every single variable or every single line. But you usually need to document all functions, their arguments and return values, and also any interesting or unusual algorithm or technique. Think of the comments as hints to the future readers of the code; the readers need to understand what your code does without reading much more than just the comments and the function and property names.

Most developers consider writing documentation a boring and unrewarding task. But that doesn’t have to be the case. API documentation can be auto-generated from comments in the code. This way you can have the documentation written without actually writing it. Most programmers find this idea fascinating, because auto-generating a readable reference from specific keywords and specially formatted “commands” looks much like actual programming.

Another way to make your code better is to have it peer reviewed.

we looked at what it means to write maintainable code—a topic that is important not only for the success of a software project but also to the sanity and well-being of the developers and those around them. Then we talked about some of the essential best practices and patterns including: • Reducing the number of globals, ideally to one per application • Using a single var per function, which helps keep an eye on all variables in a single spot and prevents surprises caused by the variable hoisting behavior • for loops, for-in loops, switches, “eval() is evil,” not augmenting built-in prototypes • Following coding conventions (consistent white space, indentation, using curly braces and semicolons even when they are optional) and naming conventions (for constructors, functions, and variables) Summary | 37 The chapter also discussed some additional practices, not related to the code, but to the programming process in general—writing comments, creating generated API documentation, conducting peer reviews, not attempting to write minified code at the expense of readability, and always checking your code with JSLint.

As you can see from this example, an obvious benefit of the literal notation is that it’s shorter to type. Another reason why the literal is the preferred pattern for object creation is that it emphasizes that objects are simply mutable hashes and not something that needs to be baked from a “recipe” (from a class). Another reason for using literals as opposed to the Object constructor is that there is no scope resolution. Because it’s possible that you have created a local constructor with the same name, the interpreter needs to look up the scope chain from the place you are calling Object() all the way up until it finds the global Object constructor.

What happens if you forget new when you invoke a constructor? This is not going to cause syntax or runtime errors but might lead to logical errors and unexpected behavior. That’s because when you forget new, this inside the constructor will point to the global object. (In browsers this will point to window.)

One more reason to stay away from new Array() is to avoid a possible trap that this constructor has in store for you. When you pass a single number to the Array() constructor, it doesn’t become the value of the first array element. It sets the length of the array instead. This means that new Array(3) creates an array with length of 3, but no actual elements. If you try to access any of the elements, you get the value undefined because the elements don’t exist. The following code example shows the different behavior when you use the literal and the constructor with a single value. // an array of one element var a = [3]; console.log(a.length); // 1 console.log(a[0]); // 3 //

when using the RegExp() constructor, you also need to escape quotes and often you need to double-escape backslashes, as shown in the preceding snippet, where we need four backslashes to match a single one. This makes your regular expression patterns longer and harder to read and modify. Regular expressions are hard enough to begin with, and any chance to simplify them is welcome, so it’s best to stick to the literal notation.

DOM access is expensive; it’s the most common bottleneck when it comes to JavaScript performance. This is because the DOM is usually implemented separately from the JavaScript engine. From a browser’s perspective, it makes sense to take this approach, because a JavaScript application may not need DOM at all. And also languages other than JavaScript (for example, VBScript in IE) can be used to work with the page’s DOM. The bottom line is that DOM access should be reduced to minimum.

Function objects are linked to Function.prototype (which is itself linked to Object.prototype). Every function is also created with two additional hidden properties: the function’s context and the code that implements the function’s behavior.
